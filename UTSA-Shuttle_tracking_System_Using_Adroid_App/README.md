# Project Summary :

Android is the latest and a rapid growing technology available for all the users in today’s market. There has been an enormous increase in the end user acceptance in the past few years. This Project is on developing an app that gives real time information about the shuttles running in UTSA, helping students to get information about shuttles and manage their time in accordance with their schedules. This project uses the shuttle location and the current location of the user to estimate the remaining time to reach the destination by using a server to feed and fetch data. 
    	
The basic idea for this project is to guide the students by displaying shuttle route maps, track their locations and show the estimate remaining time to reach. The functionalities provided by the system includes route information, shuttle information, stops information, map Generation, location tracking. Having these information in the database and constantly updating the database about the information of the shuttle and returning those information to the user.

Novelty of the Project:

1.Its convenient way to track the collage shuttles’ timing and follow the schedule effectively based on the app./
2.Real time location view based on the GPS and server data.
3.User-friendly interface.
4.More accurate to predict expected arriving time of the shuttle.


Challenges of the Project:

	User must have GPS connection smartphone.
	All the bus numbers must be stored in the database and retrieved whenever required.
	Application must get the co-ordinates from the Map and send it to the server.
	Server should show the relative current location of the Shuttle in the Graphical maps. 
	The location tracker must track the location of the passenger as well as the bus to give the estimated time, and then guide the student.
	The time given for the bus to reach the bus stop much be almost accurate, irrespective of the traffic obtained.
	The bus timings must match the real time bus arrival.

	Overview:

Tracking system gives a communication infrastructure that allows Shuttle users to query and receive this information in real time. The system uses vehicle’s positional data and route information to calculate estimated arrival times. Basically, this application at client side fetches the co-ordinates by using Maps, sends the co-ordinates to server, then server send an alerts to students who are registered for this service, also server provides Graphical Map of current Bus location by having markers on to the map. The limitations of this system are it does not provide information about density of passenger. In this system admin maintain database information of buses and the system user. The system provides information of bus to the user which is transferred via internet to android application.
